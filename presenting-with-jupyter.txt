First, we need a copy of reveal.js in the same directory as your slides.

git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git
cd reveal.js
git checkout 3.5.0
cd ..

To create a local copy of your presentation that can be accesed later:

jupyter nbconvert your_talk.ipynb --to slides --reveal-prefix reveal.js

open your_talk.slides.html

To get both speaker notes and timers to work:

jupyter nbconvert your_talk.ipynb --to slides --reveal-prefix reveal.js --post serve


Speaker notes can be accessed by pressing 's'
