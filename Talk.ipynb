    "Before we begin our exploration, it is instructive to look at the degree distribution of the underlying network on which we simulate the diffusion process. At the outset, note that we focus only on networks that have a power law distribution of node degrees in this workbook. This means that while most nodes have a small degree, there is a finite probability that some nodes have very high degree. We note that several empirical network distributions (hosted at http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/plots/degree_distribution) are networks with heavy-tailed distributions. In this context, our assumption of power law distribution of degrees is not way off-mark."

    "If we look at the mean elevation across all the simulation runs on the sample space, it looks like influentials provide a big jump in elevation compared to average individuals. This is a big +1 for the *influential hypothesis*. A direct implication of this finding is that most marketing dollars should be directed towards identifying and 'influencing' the influencers. No wonder 'influencer marketing' was the buzz word for several years!  "

    "This is not the full picture though. Averages are severely misleading. A key idea of the Tipping Point is that these 'special' individuals are able to drive large swathes of ordinary individuals into adopting the idea because of their endorsement. Such large scale sequence of adoptions following a single adoption are called *cascades*. To be really effective, influentials should be able to drive cascades that are large not only on average, but also in scale. They have to be really, really, *really* big. The kind of big that poor ordinary individuals cannot generate, ever. These kind of super large cascades are called *global cascades*.  \n",

    "A reasonable definition of a *global cascade* is one that occupies at least 10% of the network (this is based on prior literaure, but of course it is up to you to pick a cut-off). For the 10,000 node network we consider in this notebook, global cascades are those that reach 1000 nodes. Let us now see how the influencers fare on this metric. "
